# Road Registry [![Build Status](https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/road-registry/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/road-registry/actions)

The road registry is a mid-scale reference database of all Flemish roads. This code base supports

- back office tasks, such as allowing operators to download a snapshot of the registry as shape files and to upload changes to the registry
- exposing the road registry as a product, an OSLO compliant product, a snapshot for shape editing purposes

## Hosts

### Extract Legacy

The extract legacy program derives streams and events from the existing, legacy road registry database.
It stores its output into a blob called `import-streams.zip`, where the blob could be stored on the file system or in an AWS S3 bucket. This can be configured.
The blob contains one file called `streams.json`. This file is a (very long) array of `(stream, event)` tuples.
The order in which events appear in the file is the order they must be appended into the target event store.
Typically, it will start with a `BeganRoadNetworkImport` and end with a `CompletedRoadNetworkImport` on the `roadnetwork` stream.
In between all organizations, municipalities, road nodes, road segments, and grade separated junctions will be imported as well.
Each `organization` gets a stream of its own. Each `municipality` gets a stream of its own. Road nodes, segments, and grade separated junctions go into the `roadnetwork` stream.

### Import Legacy

The import legacy program takes the output of the extract legacy program and appends it to the various streams mentioned in the `streams.json` file, contained in the `import-streams.zip`.

### Editor Projection Host

This host projects the entire event stream into a series of shape and dbase records which can be composed into shape files for editing purposes, i.e. what the operator needs to do his / her work and ultimately what is part of the download.

### Product Projection Host

This host projects the entire event stream into a series of shape and dbase records which can be composed into shape files for product release purposes, i.e. what third party consumers need.

### BackOffice Event Host

This host reacts to things happening in the entire event stream, selectively choosing if, when and what to do.
When the `CompletedRoadNetworkImport` event is observed, this host will create a snapshot of the road network and store it as a blob. This will speed up access to the road network.
When the `RoadNetworkChangesArchiveAccepted` event is observed, this host will translate the changes into a command that can be picked up and handled by the BackOffice Command Host.

### BackOffice Command Host

This host react to things happening in the `roadnetwork-command-queue` event stream.
When the `ChangeRoadNetworkBasedOnArchive` command is observed, this host will try to merge the requested changes into the golden copy of the road network.

### BackOffice API

This host exposes a private API to be used by the BackOffice UI.
It allows an operator to download, upload, get information about the registry and its recent changes.

### BackOffice UI

This host exposes the website the operator can interact with to download, upload, and view information about the registry and its recent changes.

## Docker Based Integration Testing

### What do I need to install?

- docker
- docker-compose

### Overview

Please make sure you've ran `./build.sh publish` so that the self-contained .NET Core apps and their docker files are published (into the `dist` folder)
and ready to be consumed.

Blobs that usually end up in AWS S3 will in this environment be stored in a Minio container (an S3 compatible, docker-based blob store).
Data that ends up or originates from AWS RDS SQL Server will in this environment be stored in a SQL Server container (multiple).
Logging that usually ends up in DataDog will in this environment be accessible via the Seq container (Seq is a docker-based log server).

You will need a backup of the existing legacy database and put it into `src/RoadRegistry.LegacyDatabase/filled/legacydb.bak` or `src/RoadRegistry.LegacyDatabase/empty/legacydb.bak`.
The former is meant to represent a master copy of the legacy road registry database, the latter a stripped down version with barely any data. They will have to prove their usefulness over time.

To seed the legacy database you can type

`docker-compose up --build empty-legacy-mssql-seed`

or

`docker-compose up --build filled-legacy-mssql-seed`

To test whether the extraction works you can type

`docker-compose up --build extract-empty-legacy`

or

`docker-compose up --build extract-filled-legacy`

To test whether the import works you can type

`docker-compose up --build import-legacy`

To test whether the editor projection host works you can type

`docker-compose up --build editor-projection-host`

To test whether the product projection host works you can type

`docker-compose up --build product-projection-host`

To test whether the backoffice event host works you can type

`docker-compose up --build backoffice-event-host`

To test whether the backoffice command host works you can type

`docker-compose up --build backoffice-command-host`

To test whether the backoffice api and ui work you can type

`docker-compose up --build backoffice-api backoffice-ui`

Several projections use a cache called the syndication projections. 
These are built from the streetname and municipality registries, using their respective syndication feeds.
You will need a copy of the Municipality Syndication table from the municipality registry

`bcp MunicipalityRegistryLegacy.MunicipalitySyndication out ./syndication.bcp -S<host>,<port> -U <user> -d municipality-registry -n -E`

and a copy of the StreetName Syndication table from the street name registry

`bcp StreetNameRegistryLegacy.StreetNameSyndication out ./syndication.bcp -S<host>,<port> -U <user> -d streetname-registry -n -E`

and copy these to `src/RoadRegistry.MunicipalityDatabase/filled` and `src/RoadRegistry.StreetNameDatabase/filled` respectively.

To seed the database for these syndication feeds you can type

`docker-compose up --build filled-streetname-mssql-seed`

and

`docker-compose up --build filled-municipality-mssql-seed`

To test whether building the syndication projection works you can type

`docker-compose up --build syndication-projection-host`
